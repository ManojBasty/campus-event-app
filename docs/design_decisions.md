# ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions

1. **Tech Stack**  
   - **Backend** â†’ Node.js + Express + SQLite (simple, portable).  
   - **Frontend** â†’ React (Vite for fast dev), Tailwind CSS (for styling), Recharts (for charts).  
   - **API Communication** â†’ Axios is used for clean HTTP requests.  

2. **Architecture**  
   - Backend follows **REST API design**: `/colleges`, `/events`, `/reports/...`.  
   - Database has normalized tables: **colleges**, **students**, **events**, **registrations**, **attendance**.  
   - Reports (popularity, most active students, participation) are computed via SQL joins/aggregates.  

3. **UI/UX**  
   - Dashboard layout uses **cards in a grid** for readability.  
   - Added **filters (event type)** and **search (student participation by ID)** to improve usability.  
   - Responsive design ensures it works on both desktop and mobile.  

4. **Scalability**  
   - SQLite is fine for a prototype, but the same schema can migrate to MySQL/Postgres later.  
   - Separate frontend & backend structure makes deployment flexible.  

5. **Deployment Choice**  
   - Single backend server serves both API + frontend build â†’ simple deployment.  
   - Can easily be hosted on **Render/Railway/Heroku** for free student projects.
